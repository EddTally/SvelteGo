# SvelteGo
Testing a Golang backend with SvelteKit frontend

To get it up and working:

In a terminal run this to get the gin server started  
> cd web-service-gin  
> go mod tidy  
> go run .  

In a seperate terminal run this to start the website  
> cd sveltekit  
> npm install  
> npm run dev  

You'll need a postgres database and to set the environment variables in a .env file in web-service-gin.

Current problem:  
- None!
